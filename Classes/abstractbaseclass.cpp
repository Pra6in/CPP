// pure virtual members can be called
// from the abstract base class

/*Abstract base classes are something very similar to the Polygon class in the previous example.
 They are classes that can only be used as base classes, and thus are allowed to have virtual member functions
  without definition (known as pure virtual functions). The syntax is to replace their definition by =0
   (an equal sign and a zero): */
